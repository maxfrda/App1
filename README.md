# The Simple Diary

This app is designed to be a diary app that is simple and clean, without the unnecessary features that other similar apps have. 

It will work on desktop and mobile, however it was primarily designed for desktop, as I personally do not enjoy text entry
on a mobile device. 

You can create, update, and delete entries, however the update feature does not update the original text but instead inserts a new "updated" section that gets time-stamped, as it is meant to be used when coming back to an entry later. The thinking here was that diaries are meant to be time-capsules, so you shouldn't be able to go back and edit the original text. If you really don't like it though, you can delete the entire entry. 

No API is used for text entry, instead I use a contenteditable DIV. 

I used jquery and javascript to handle the user interface.
